<Steps>

1. **Install VibeKit**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://getvibekit.ai/install | sh
   ```

2. **Initialize your project**

   ```bash
   vibekit init
   ```

   The CLI walks you through setup, then creates everything your AI needs. **Skills** teach your AI Algorand patterns. **MCP servers** give it tools to interact with the network.

3. **Verify setup**

   ```bash
   vibekit status
   ```

4. **Start building**

   Open your AI tool and ask it to create a smart contract project, build and test it, or deploy to localnet.

</Steps>

That's it. Your AI now knows Algorand.
