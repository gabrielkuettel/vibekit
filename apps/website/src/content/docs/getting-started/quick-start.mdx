import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

## 1. Install VibeKit

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="macOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://getvibekit.ai/install | sh
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    irm https://getvibekit.ai/install.ps1 | iex
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Initialize your project

```bash
vibekit init
```

The CLI walks you through setup, then creates everything your AI needs. **Skills** teach your AI Algorand patterns. **MCP servers** give it tools to interact with the network.

## 3. Verify setup

```bash
vibekit status
```

## 4. Start building

Open your AI tool and ask it to create a smart contract project, build and test it, or deploy to localnet.

That's it. Your AI now knows Algorand.
