import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These commands handle irreversible account operations. They require explicit confirmation and are CLI-only by design—your AI agent can't accidentally run them.

Most day-to-day account operations (create, list, fund, send) happen through MCP tools. The CLI only exposes the dangerous ones.

## Commands

```bash
vibekit account rekey-to-self <name> --provider=<vault|keyring> --network=<network>
vibekit account remove <name> --provider=<vault|keyring>
```

## rekey-to-self

Transfers signing authority from VibeKit to your personal wallet.

```bash
vibekit account rekey-to-self deployer --provider=vault --network=testnet
```

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `--provider` | Yes | `vault` or `keyring` |
| `--network` | Yes | `localnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` |

The command prompts for your wallet address, then submits a rekey transaction. After this:

- VibeKit can no longer sign for this account
- Your wallet controls all future transactions
- The account address stays the same

<Aside type="caution">
  This is irreversible. Use it when you're done developing and want to move an account to production under your own custody.
</Aside>

## remove

Permanently deletes an account from the provider.

```bash
vibekit account remove test-account --provider=keyring
```

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `--provider` | Yes | `vault` or `keyring` |

<Aside type="caution">
  The private key is gone forever. Transfer assets and close out applications first.
</Aside>

## Why CLI-only?

1. **Human confirmation** — You type the command
2. **No AI accidents** — Agent tools can't delete accounts
3. **Audit trail** — Terminal history captures the action
