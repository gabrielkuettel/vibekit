<Aside type="note" title="Experimental">
  Vault runs HashiCorp Vault in Docker on your machine. It's intended for teams managing shared development keys, but that workflow is still evolving.
</Aside>

## Commands

```bash
vibekit vault start              # Start and unseal
vibekit vault stop               # Stop container
vibekit vault unseal             # Unseal a running Vault
vibekit vault status             # Show status
vibekit vault token create       # Create MCP token
vibekit vault token revoke       # Revoke MCP token
vibekit vault token status       # Show token info
```

## start

Starts the Vault container and unseals it. On first run, initializes Vault and displays your root token and unseal key.

```bash
vibekit vault start
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Save the root token and unseal key somewhere safe. They're shown once and never stored by VibeKit. Lose them and you're locked out.
</Aside>

## stop

Stops the container. Vault seals itself on stop.

```bash
vibekit vault stop
```

## unseal

Unseals a running but sealed Vault. Prompts for your unseal key.

```bash
vibekit vault unseal
```

## status

Shows container state, seal status, and MCP token info.

```bash
vibekit vault status
```

## token create

Creates an MCP token with limited permissions. The AI can sign transactions and list accounts, but can't export keys, delete accounts, or access admin functions.

```bash
vibekit vault token create
vibekit vault token create --ttl 7d
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--ttl` | `768h` (32 days) | Token expiry (e.g., `7d`, `720h`) |

The token is stored in your OS keyring.

## token revoke

Revokes the current MCP token. Use this if the token may be compromised or you want to rotate credentials.

```bash
vibekit vault token revoke
```

## token status

Shows token details including creation time, expiry, and policies.

```bash
vibekit vault token status
```

## Environment variables

For automation (CI/CD, scripts), you can skip interactive prompts:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `VIBEKIT_VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY` | Skip unseal prompt |
| `VIBEKIT_VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN` | Skip root token prompt |
| `VAULT_ADDR` | Custom Vault URL (default: `http://localhost:8200`) |

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- Port 8200 available
