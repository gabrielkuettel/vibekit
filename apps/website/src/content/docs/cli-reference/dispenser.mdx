---

The TestNet dispenser (faucet) requires authentication. Once logged in, your AI can fund accounts on TestNet.

## Commands

```bash
vibekit dispenser login    # Authenticate
vibekit dispenser logout   # Remove token
```

## login

Authenticates with the Algorand TestNet dispenser using OAuth device flow.

```bash
vibekit dispenser login
```

The CLI displays a device code and opens your browser. Enter the code, sign in, and the token is saved to your OS keyring. Tokens are valid for 30 days.

## logout

Removes the saved token.

```bash
vibekit dispenser logout
```

## After login

Your AI can fund accounts on TestNet:

```
"Fund my deployer account with 10 ALGO on testnet"
```

Rate limits apply—there's a per-account cooldown.

## LocalNet vs TestNet

| | LocalNet | TestNet |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Auth | None (uses KMD) | Required |
| Funds | Unlimited | Rate limited |
| Persistence | Resets on restart | Permanent |

Use LocalNet for development, TestNet for integration testing.
